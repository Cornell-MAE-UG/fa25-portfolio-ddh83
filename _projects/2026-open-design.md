**Problem Statement**

Grape farmers want to prevent spotted lanternflies from feeding on grapevines throughout the year and  entering grape products during harvesting. Pesticides can protect grape vines for most of the year, but they must stop being used at least a week prior to the grape harvest. Research has shown a similar system to anti-bird netting with more refined mesh (6 x 1.8mm) is able to reduce spotted lanternfly infestation by 99.8 percent. However, this solution presents a different challenge: the netting needs to be removed before harvesting and re-applied right after harvest unlike antibird netting. The netting setup and takedown processes require significant time and manual labor. While the netting is down, vineyards are vulnerable. The grape harvest aligns with peak spotted lanternfly activity, so, without pesticides or nets, lanternflies will get into grape products and cause damage to the vines. 

Despite its potential effectiveness at protecting grape vines, very fine mesh has seen limited use.  Large-scale vineyards are unable to efficiently use small scale, drape-over-the-vine nets because of the significant time and labor required in installation and removal. If this process is made more efficient, more vineyards could use this fine mesh to prevent lanternflies from accessing the vines.

Our concept is a series of poles and rails.
